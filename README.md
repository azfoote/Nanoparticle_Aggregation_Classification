# Nanoparticle_Aggregation_Classification
A convolutional neural network based deep learning classifier designed to classify solutions of nanoparticles as toxic or non-toxic based on their level of aggregation.  Includes sample images and required python code to build and run the classifier.

The purpose of this project is to develop and train a convolutional neural network that is able to classify a given microscope image of nanoparticles in solution as toxic or non-toxic.  Nanoparticles that have aggregated appear under the microscope as black blots that can vary in size and shape. An excess amount of these aggregates can cause toxcity when the nanoparticles are incubated with living
cells.  Some microscope images contain no aggregates, and some are completely full of aggregates, in which case the toxicity level is clear.

This project is designed for the cases in which the toxicity level is borderline, and may or may not have a toxic impact on cells.
The materials used to create the nanoparticles are expensive, and it takes time and expertise to produce and disperse the nanoparticles.
Furthermore, testing the toxicity of a given batch of nanoparticles is a time intesive process, often taking a week or more.

Being able to predict if a given batch of nanoparticles is toxic quickly from a microscopy image is valuable, and is the goal of this project.
